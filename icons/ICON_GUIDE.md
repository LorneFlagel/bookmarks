# Icon Generation Guide

## Quick Start

Run the Python script to generate all icon files:

```bash
python generate_icons.py
```

If you don't have Pillow installed:
```bash
pip install Pillow
```

This will create all 4 required icon sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 96x96) with a beautiful bookmark design.

## What the Icons Look Like

The script creates purple-blue bookmark icons that match your extension's color scheme:
- Bookmark shape with a V-notch at the bottom
- Gradient and shadow effects for depth
- Clean, professional design
- Looks great at all sizes
